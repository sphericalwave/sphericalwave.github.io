  <div class="col-6">
    <p>You don't know what you don't know.</p>
    <p>You don't question what you believe.</p>
    <p>The path to realization is becoming familiar with a vision.</p>
    <p>You can do this by visualizing the same scenes over and over.</p>
    <p>It will probably take months initially.</p>
    <p>You vision is worth the work, the alternative is chaos.</p>
    <p>But once your imagination accepts the sights, scents, sounds, and feelings</p>
    <p>The dream will start to take shape in the real world</p>
    <p>Belief is the battle</p>
    <p>Faith is a virtue that can be developed by this method</p>
    <p>Fear vanishes in the presence of Faith</p>
    <p>It's something you have to experience to believe</p>
    <p>But it's worth the effort</p>
    <p>Keep track of your practice in a spreadsheet</p>
    <p>Once you've done it once, you'll have faith you can do it again</p>
    <p>When that happens, you've escaped morphic resonance</p>
    <p>Now you are a creator</p>
